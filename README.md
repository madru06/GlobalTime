# Global Time

A light, user-frendly and compact tool as an online site to get the hour in another countries.

## How it works

GlobalTime automatically set your current hour base in your country location, therefore, you just have to select the country you want to get the current hour by comparison.

If you need to find another hour at the target country, just change the current time at yours.
